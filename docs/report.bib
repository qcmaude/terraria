doi = {10.1093/comjnl/24.2.167}, 
abstract ={The Delaunay tessellation in n-dimensional space is a space-filling aggregate of n-simplices. These n-simplices are the dual forms of the vertices in the commonly used Voronoi tessellation. Several efforts have been made to simulate the 2-dimensional Voronoi tessellation on the computer. Additional problems occur for the 3 and higher dimensional implementations but some of these can be avoided by alternatively computing the dual Delaunay tessellation. An algorithm that finds the topological relationships in these tessellations is given.},
